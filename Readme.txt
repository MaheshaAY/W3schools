Hi, 

i'm Mahesha A Y s/o Yogesha
Working @X_Company

Pull is a combination of fetch and merge

Again checking a pull command

Push : Now we are making changes in the local repo and pushing it to remote repo, let's see how it works.
	 And worked!

this line added in "local-branch"

merging didn't happen properly?  

from branch - 1

this line again from branch - 1

ok let's create some conflict now.
